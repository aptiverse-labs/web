const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "Is it really useful on the free plan?",
    a: "Yes. Goals, the diary, mood check-ins, practice, past papers, and the whole career navigator are free, with a monthly allowance of AI study questions. You only pay when you want the full assistant, more practice, and predictions.",
  },
  {
    q: "I am at university, not school. Does it fit?",
    // Was "past papers" for school and "career matching" for university. Past
    // papers are a DBE link-out, so a university student gets nothing there,
    // and it would be a poor reason to pick us. Career matching is the career
    // navigator, which is real but works off requirements you enter yourself,
    // not a matching engine.
    a: "Yes. Set your stage to tertiary and Aptiverse shows the courses you added and their coursework instead of school subjects, with a projection per course. The career navigator works the same either way: you enter what your degree or your next year needs, and it tracks each requirement against your real marks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the assistant just give me the answers?",
    a: "No, and that is deliberate. It explains the concept, then sets you a question to try. You learn how to get there, which is what actually moves your marks.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can my parents read my diary?",
    // Was: "end-to-end encrypted on your device. Not your parents, not us."
    // The first half is invented and the second half is false because of it.
    // A student deciding how honest to be in a diary is owed the real answer,
    // including the part that is not flattering to us. The access boundary is
    // real and enforced; the cryptography was never built.
    a: "Your parents, no. There is no screen in the parent view that shows entries and no endpoint that returns them, so it is not a setting they can turn on. Being straight with you about the rest: entries are stored on our servers as ordinary text, not encrypted on your device, so Aptiverse staff access is governed by our privacy policy rather than by mathematics. If that matters to you, it should shape what you write.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will it work on a cheap phone with little data?",
    // Was "the diary works offline and practice caches, syncing when you are
    // back online". There is no service worker, no manifest, no local store
    // and no sync anywhere in the app. The mobile-first half is true.
    a: "It is built mobile-first and is light on data, so it holds up on a modest phone. It does need a connection, though: there is no offline mode, and nothing you write is stored on the phone to sync later.",
