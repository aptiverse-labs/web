// file, ParentLinksController.cs. No other endpoint consults it, so no other
// endpoint can hand a parent any child's data. Everything below that promised
// a per-child read was promising something the API has no path to deliver.
//
// - "How-can-I-help view": /parent/help is a hardcoded TIPS array with
//   invented children and invented mastery numbers. Nothing reads Mastery.
// - "Celebration alerts": every celebration emitter targets the actor, never a
//   parent (GoalEvaluator.cs:115 -> studentId). /parent/celebrations is a
//   hardcoded array of children who do not exist.
// - "Activity, with consent": there is no consent flag and no activity feed.
//   The fields on the Child type are never read by any component.
// - "Wellbeing summary": /parent/wellbeing calls an endpoint that does not
//   exist and would draw Math.random() if it did.
// - "Goal progress": StudentOverviewDto has no goals field.
//
// Three of those pages are not even in PARENT_NAV, which is presumably how a
// permanently-404ing fetch and a random-number chart survived this long.
//
// What is left is real: the dashboard, the assessment feed, and the privacy
// boundary, which is the one thing here that is enforced rather than
// described. Three honest cards beat six invented ones.

  {
    q: "How many children can I add?",
    a: "One to four. You pick the Parent plan that matches your number of children, and each child gets their own private account under your single subscription and one bill.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does the pricing work as I add children?",
    a: "Each child on a Parent plan gets everything in Student Pro, and you get the parent dashboard on top. One child is R159 a month, two is R269, three is R379, and four is R489, so each additional child costs less than the one before. Annual billing gives you two months free.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I read my child's diary or messages?",
    // Was: "the diary is end-to-end encrypted on your child's device". It is
    // not, and answering a parent's direct privacy question with a technical
    // guarantee we do not implement is the worst place in the product to be
    // loose with the truth. The access boundary is real and enforced in the
    // API; the encryption was invented. Say the part that is true, and say
    // honestly what we can see.
    a: "No. There is no screen anywhere in the parent view that shows diary entries, and no endpoint that returns them. You see mood trends, streaks and celebrations, never the words. That boundary is deliberate and cannot be turned off. To be straight with you about the limits: entries are stored on our servers, not encrypted on your child's device, and our systems read them to spot a rough patch. So we can see them, and staff access is governed by our privacy policy. What is guaranteed is that you cannot.",
  },
  {
    q: "My children are different ages. Does that work?",
    // Was "from primary school through university", with a Grade 8 as the
    // worked example. Onboarding offers Grade 10, 11, 12 and tertiary. There
    // is no primary school option and no Grade 8. A parent of a younger child
    // would have signed up and found nothing for them.
    a: "Within a range. Aptiverse covers Grade 10 to 12 and university or college, so a Grade 10 and a first-year fit under the same family account and each get tools for their own stage. We do not currently support anything below Grade 10.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does the free tier give us?",
    // Was "a Parent plan adds the full assistant, predictions, and past papers
    // for every child". Past papers are free (features.ts baseline), and term
    // predictions are not gated anywhere, so a free child already has both. We
    // were charging for two things we hand out.
    a: "More than you would expect. Each child can start free with goals, the diary, mood check-ins, practice, past papers, term predictions, and the career navigator. A Parent plan raises their AI limits, unlocks unlimited subjects, and gives you the parent dashboard across all of them.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will my child know what I can see?",
    // Was "Yes. Aptiverse is clear with your child about exactly what is
    // shared." There is no such disclosure anywhere in the student app. We
    // were describing an intention as a shipped feature, in the answer to a
    // question about trust. The honest version is that the boundary is
    // enforced but the telling is still on us, and on you.
    a: "The boundary is enforced whether they know it or not: there is no path for you to read a diary entry, a chat, or a mood note. We do not yet show your child a plain summary of what a linked parent can see, which we should, so for now that conversation is yours to have. The short version to give them: you can see what is due, and nothing else.",
