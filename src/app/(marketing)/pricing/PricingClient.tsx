    // a tertiary student gets nothing from them, so it was a poor thing to

    q: "Is my data safe?",
    // "Your diary is end-to-end encrypted by default, so even we cannot read

On the diary specifically, be clear on what we do and do not promise: no parent, teacher, or other student can read it, and there is no endpoint that would let them. It is not end-to-end encrypted, though. Entries are stored as ordinary text on our servers, so staff access is governed by policy and access control rather than by cryptography.",
