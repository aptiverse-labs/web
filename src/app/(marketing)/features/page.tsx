            Worth recording for whoever picks up the encryption question: right
            now the AI does not read the diary at all, because that event never

// - "Celebration alerts": a "celebration" notification type is real, but every
//   emitter targets the actor themselves (GoalEvaluator.cs:115 -> studentId).
//   No parent-directed celebration exists. /parent/celebrations is a
//   hardcoded array of invented children.
// - "Shared calendar": CalendarController.cs:12 returns an empty array to
//   everyone, unconditionally. There is no per-user calendar to share.
//
// What survives is the dashboard (real page, real linked children, real
// upcoming assessments) and the privacy boundary, which is the one thing here
// that is enforced rather than described. So we sell those two honestly and
// say plainly what a parent does not get, rather than inventing a third.
