            app, and the server writes SentimentAnalysis and KeyThemes onto the
            entry, which is only possible because the server reads the text.

            It also claimed the diary works offline, which nothing implements.

            This one mattered more than the rest: it invited a teenager to write
            something they would only write somewhere truly private, on a
            promise the system cannot keep. What is written below is what the
            product actually does. If we want to make the stronger claim, we
            have to build it first, and building it means giving up the
            sentiment analysis that reads the text. */}
