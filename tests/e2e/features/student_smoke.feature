Feature: Student page smoke tests
  Every page in the student dashboard loads without crashing and shows
  its expected hero title / heading. Catches regressions in routing,
  layout, route guards, and per-page imports.

  Scenario Outline: <name> page loads
    When I open "<path>"
    Then I should see "<text>"
